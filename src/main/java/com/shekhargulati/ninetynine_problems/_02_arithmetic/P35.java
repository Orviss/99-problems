/**
 * (**) Goldbach's conjecture
 * <p>
 * Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.
 * Example: 28 = 5 + 23. It is one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved to be correct
 * in the general case. It has been numerically confirmed up to very large numbers.
 * Write a predicate to find the two prime numbers that sum up to a given even integer.
